When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When it's a project that you want others to work on as well.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automattically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because sometimes the developer may not be finished with their code before the automatic commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A branch is a new direction in the code starting from some previous commit.
	A clone is an exact copy of some repository.
	A fork is a clone of a repository tracked automatically by github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If the developers is offline they can continue to work on the local branch then merge it with the lastest remote repository without using the internet.

How would you collaborate without using git or github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	Simply saving different loose versions of the file. I guess you wouldn't have to worry about all the steps of version control, but then again, there would be no chronological path for the build.
