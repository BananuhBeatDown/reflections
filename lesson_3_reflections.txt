When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When it's a project that you want others to work on as well.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automattically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because sometimes the developer may not be finished with their code before the automatic commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A branch is a new direction in the code starting from some previous commit.
	A clone is an exact copy of some repository.
	A fork is a clone of a repository tracked automatically by github.
